To fix the error "Failed to load PostCSS config: Failed to load PostCSS config", follow these steps:

    Remove the "type": "module" configuration from the project's package.json file to revert back to using CommonJS modules.
    
Alternatively:

    Locate the PostCSS configuration file with a ".js" extension that is causing the error.
    Rename the file to have a ".cjs" extension.
    

This should resolve the issue and allow you to load the PostCSS configuration file without errors.
